**Solution**:

$s = \sqrt{\frac 1{n-p} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat y_i)^2} = \sqrt{\frac 1{n-p} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - [\mathbb{X}\mathbf{b}]_i)^2}$

where 

* $n-p$ is the degrees of freedom in the model; $p$ is equal to 7
  
* $y_i$ is the observed math score in 8th grade for student i
  
* $\hat y_i$ is the predicted math score in 8th grade for student i from the model above.
  
* $\mathbb{X} = [x_{ij}]$ is a $n \times 7$ matrix with $x_{i1}=1$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$, $x_{i2}$ is the parents' socioeconomic status for student $i$, $x_{i3}$ equals 1 if 'paredu' = college and 0 otherwise, $x_{i4}$ equals 1 if 'paredu' = high school and 0 otherwise, $x_{i5}$ equals 1 if 'paredu' = below high school and 0 otherwise, $x_{i6}$ equals 1 if 'paredu' = MA and 0 otherwise, and $x_{i7}$ equals 1 if 'paredu' = PhD and 0 otherwise.
  
* $\mathbf{b} = (b_1, \dots, b_7)$ are the estimated coefficients.
